# Earth Roadmap

Living shared plan for Earth feature work across `dev-kitt` and `qa-kitt`.
Update this file at the start and end of every session.

## Agent Roster

| Agent | Identity | Focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Earth | `deve10per` / dev-kitt | Earth features, layers, governance |
| Fixes | `deve10per` / dev-kitt | Bug fixes, test repair, CI |
| Docs | `eng1neer` / qa-kitt | READLESS, CODEX, EARTH-ROADMAP |

Agents share `origin/main` on xyz (`random-knights/xyz`). Pull before push. One owner per surface at a time.

**Coordination standards:** [`automation/agent-coordination-standards.md`](automation/agent-coordination-standards.md) — callout format, verify-from-git rule, scoped reads, path-ownership matrix, HANDOFF protocol.

## Deploy Checkpoint Status

| Checkpoint | State | CI | Deployed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Earth UI Cleanup + Live Connections | merged to main | green | **✓ live** |
| Air-Quality (18th live layer) + Ocean loader | merged to main | green | **✓ live** |
| Earth Fast workflow test rewrite | merged to main | green | **✓ live** |
| @scient1st real Earth-context AI responses | merged to main | green (+374, 0 failures) | **✓ live** |
| scientist-session-continuity (6 commits) | merged to main | green | **pending** |

`origin/main` (xyz) is at `6d2c6cb` (scientist-session-continuity merged). Production Release `27374833292` covers all prior checkpoints. Session-continuity checkpoint deployed only after owner-confirmed release.

Next checkpoint: owner triggers `90-production-release.yml` from `main` (`6d2c6cb`) to ship session-continuity live.

---

## Now

_Active — in flight or ready for immediate action._

- **Earth agent:** `earth/scientist-session-continuity` complete and merged to main (`6d2c6cb`). `earth_tab.dart` 2,387→1,375 lines — stretch goal met. Deployed: pending owner Production Release.
- **Fixes agent:** F1.0 Dynamic Web Favicon on `feature/f1-0-*` — held; merges to main only after Earth session-continuity checkpoint deploy confirms clean. No branch switching in shared clone while merge is pending (see Pivots).
- **Docs agent:** roadmap current. Pending-owner-approval queue open (see below). ✓

---

## Next

_Queued — approved scope, not yet started._

1. Owner triggers Production Release (`90-production-release.yml`) from `main` (`6d2c6cb`) — ships session-continuity live.
2. After deploy confirmed: Fixes agent merges `feature/f1-0-*` (F1.0 Dynamic Web Favicon) to main.
3. Delete stale/merged remote branches: `earth/earthview-ui-cleanup`, `earth/live-connections-batch`, `chore/earth-workflow-test-staleness`, `earth/scientist-live-ai-responses`, `earth/scientist-session-continuity`. Delete abandoned: `earth/p17-7-scientist-context-bridge`, `earth/p18-0/1/2-*` (see Pivots).
4. **Pending owner approval** (see Pending Owner Approval section): scenario-engine ↔ @scient1st pre-spec; Connect-agent + Earth-Systems vertical agent staffing.
5. Begin next Earth phase on a fresh `earth/**` branch once owner approves scope.

## Done

_Completed and on `main`._

- **Dashboard + AIEDS + Docs** — shipped to production previously. ✓
- **Earth UI Cleanup** (`earthview-ui-cleanup`) — merged to main. Earth View score/summary to dashboard aesthetic; Earth+ squeeze fix; Oracles animated gif + custom font. ✓
- **Live Connections Batch** (`live-connections-batch`) — merged to main. Air-quality + ocean governed live Data View cards; live-connection data vertical. Ocean-currents catalog status remains **research** (card-only surface; "wired to live loader" refers to the card wiring, not a live data feed — intentional, consistent with air-quality health-neutral pivot). ✓
- **Air-Quality 18th Layer** (`1dea432`) — Earth agent. Governed `EarthLayerDefinition` for air-quality (Open-Meteo); live layer grid card; ocean-currents wired to live loader; registry/region-ready count updated 13→14; governance + registry tests added. ✓
- **Earth Fast Workflow Test Rewrite** (`75e46b6`) — Earth + Fixes agents (converged). `earth_fast_validation_test` rewritten to assert current numbered workflow scheme (01/80/90/99); retired stale workflow references. FF'd to main this session. ✓
- **CODEX.md — Session Bootstrap + EARTH-ROADMAP step** — Docs agent. Full Session Bootstrap, parallel-agent protocol, numbered workflow policy, and step 6 added. Merged to dev-kitt master. ✓
- **EARTH-ROADMAP.md created** — Docs agent. Living plan seeded and published to qa-kitt main. ✓
- **@scient1st real Earth-context AI responses** (`01a070a`) — Earth agent. `earth/scientist-live-ai-responses` merged to main. Earth Fast Cycle green (+374, 0 failures; one async widget-test break fixed inline). **Deployed ✓** (Production Release `27374833292`).
- **Production Release `27374833292`** — owner. @scient1st, air-quality, ocean live cards, UI cleanup live on `rand0m.ai`. ✓
- **`earth/scientist-session-continuity`** (`6d2c6cb`, 6 commits) — Earth agent. Phases 0–2: `EarthScientistController` + `ScientistResponsePane` extracted; request-token race safety; bounded in-memory transcript (5 exchanges, exclusion-gated). Slice 2.5: renderer readiness/usage panels + data-view sections extracted. Phases 3–4: AIEDS session ledger + soft budget guard (`sessionTokenBudget=50000`, `maxPromptTokens=12000`); stale packet-line fix; prompt size cap. `earth_tab.dart` 2,387→1,375 lines — stretch goal met. Merged to main. Deployed: pending owner Production Release.

## Pivots

_Scope changes, strategy shifts, or deferred decisions._

- Cesium bridge planning frozen at V2.16. Next Cesium work is runtime implementation only.
- Earth Vision (imagery/processing) is tooling/research-only until architecture is approved.
- Air-quality is health/trend-neutral (`influencesEarthHealthScore/Trend = false`): live card only, not folded into Earth health score.
- **`earth/p17-7-scientist-context-bridge`, `earth/p18-0-earth-agent-activation`, `earth/p18-1-scientist-command-surface`, `earth/p18-2-scientist-preview-response`** — abandoned. Audited: ~74k-line divergent rewrites vs main; not a safe merge basis. @scient1st shipped fresh on `earth/scientist-live-ai-responses` from current `main` instead. Candidates for deletion.
- **`earth_tab.dart` extraction:** merge gate (<2,000 lines, CODEX threshold) and stretch goal (<1,500 lines) both met at `6d2c6cb` — file is at 1,375 lines. Gate closed.
- **`EarthScientistConfig.liveProviderEnabled` is compile-time.** Disabling the live-AI path requires a code change, rebuild, and Production Release — not a runtime toggle. Live answers cost real tokens via the Default AI Provider through `generateAIResponse` Firebase callable.
- **`sessionTokenBudget=50000` / `maxPromptTokens=12000` are compile-time in-memory soft guards.** They reset on app relaunch and do not hard-cap Firebase Function invocations. Owner-accepted at this checkpoint. Future infra queue: remote-config budget + runtime kill switch (separate approved phase required — do not implement without explicit instruction).
- **F1.0 Dynamic Web Favicon containment (Fixes agent, owner-sanctioned exception):** `feature/f1-0-*` branch holds the favicon feature. It is an approved exception to the Earth-only lockdown. Merge order is enforced: `feature/f1-0-*` merges to main **only after** the `earth/scientist-session-continuity` checkpoint deploy is confirmed. Do not `git checkout` or `git switch` to `feature/f1-0-*` in the shared `apps/rand0m` clone while Earth's merge or deploy is pending.
- **Ocean-currents catalog status:** remains `research` despite live-loader card wiring. Card surfaces the layer; underlying data feed is not live. Intentional — matches air-quality health-neutral, card-only pattern.

## Pending Owner Approval

_Items that require an explicit owner decision before any agent proceeds._

**1. Scenario-engine ↔ @scient1st integration (pre-spec)**
A pre-spec is proposed for wiring the Earth scenario engine into @scient1st
response generation — scenarios inform context, @scient1st surfaces results.
No implementation scope, timeline, or agent assignment is approved yet.
Requires owner sign-off on: scope boundaries, whether scenario engine changes
are in-scope for the next Earth phase, and which agent owns the work.

**2. Connect-agent staffing (Fable proposal)**
Fable proposes a dedicated Connect-agent role (parallel to Earth agent) to own
the connection globe, source registry, provider/source management, and source
onboarding surfaces. Currently all agent work is Earth-locked per CODEX.
Requires owner decision on: whether to unlock Connect work, agent identity/
repo access for a Connect agent, and how Connect and Earth coordinate on shared
entry points (`c0nnect` route).

**3. Earth-Systems vertical agent staffing (Fable proposal)**
Fable proposes an Earth-Systems agent for deep Earth layer governance,
data-provider contracts, and overlay policy — distinct from the Earth feature
agent. Requires owner decision on: whether this split makes sense at current
team scale, scope separation from Earth agent, and CODEX amendments needed.

_Do not begin work on any of the above until the owner explicitly approves scope
and assigns ownership._

## Roadmap-vs-Git Ancestry Anomaly

**Status: closed** (session 3 correction; standards codified in [`automation/agent-coordination-standards.md`](automation/agent-coordination-standards.md) §6).

Root cause: roadmap seeded from session memory rather than `git log` / `git merge-base` verification. Standing rule: always verify `origin/main` SHA with `git log -1 origin/main` before recording it. Never copy a SHA from prior-session prose.
